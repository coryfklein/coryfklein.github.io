Do you want to expand your orchid collection on a budget? Join this spring's Utah Orchid Flask group buy.

Orchid growers sell tiny baby orchids in bulk by the "flask" for $30-400 each. If we buy several of these flasks together then we can share the cost of purchase and split each flask out amongst ourselves to get a variety of species.

If this sounds interesting to you, then continue reading. The minimum buy-in for this order is just $25 and guarantees you 3-5 baby orchids from 3+ separate species. The more you pay, the more you get. The more folks that join, the greater variety of species we'll be able to order.
